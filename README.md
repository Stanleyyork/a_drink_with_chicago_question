a_drink_with_chicago_question
=============================

Pull "If you could have a drinks with anyone?" question from all "A Drink With Chicago" blogposts

I’ve always been enthralled with this question, but since I started reading A Drink With Chicago faxless payday loans, it’s brought on new curiosity. See, the team over at ADWC are doing an amazing job not just doing interviews, but creating accessible experiences for us to get to know people. Hillary and Kelly end every interview with “If you could have a drink with anyone, who would it be?”. I’ve always thought this question was an insight into people you wouldn’t normally get if you simply asked “tell me about yourself”. I’ve been so enthralled with their interviews and this question that, while I’m only about 10% of the way through, I wanted to get a better understanding of the last question, so I threw together a simple ruby script (okay, it took me longer than expected) to pull this question and answers from their site (thanks girls!).
